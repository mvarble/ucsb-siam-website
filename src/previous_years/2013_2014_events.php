			  <p>INVITED SPEAKER: <b>Professor Vasudevan
					Mangalam</b>, Statistics
					Department </p>
			  <p>TIME: 5:15-6:05 pm</p>
					<p>TITLE: The Monty Hall problem and its generalizations</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal that was made famous by its appearance in Marilyn vos Savant's Ask Marilyn column in the Parade magazine. Some generalizations of the original problem are considered here. The probability distribution is changed from the equal likelihood case
to a given prior distribution, and the number of doors is increased to
					an arbitrary n. Variations of
					the original problem are also
					considered. (suitable for many
					non-probabilists). </p>

					<h2>Grad Analysis Seminar -
					Spring 2014</h2>
			  <p>DATE: Monday,  19th May,  12:30 -- 1:30pm,  SH 6617</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Ricardo (Ric)
					Delgadillo </p>
					<p>TITLE: -- </p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: I will give a talk about an approximate solution to the Schrodinger
Equation with N-electron and M-nuclei, the so called Restricted
Hartree-Fock equations. I will discuss how one uses the SCF procedure to
solve the Fock equations numerically. This involves choosing a basis set
to approximate orbital wave functions and computing 1 and 2 electron
integrals (to be defined). If time permits, I can also discuss the minimal
basis set or the Unrestricted Hartree-Fock Equations.</p>
					<br>

			  <p>DATE: Monday,  5th May,  12:30 -- 1:30pm,  SH 6617</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Chris Gorman </p>
					<p>TITLE: The Fourier Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, and Applications</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: In this talk we will review some properties of the Fourier
Transform and look at some of its applications. Then, we will look at its
discretization, the Discrete Fourier Transform, and an efficient
implementation often referred to as the Fast Fourier Transform. We will
conclude with some properties of the FFT and its use in data analysis. We
will not assume exposure to numerical analysis in this talk.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Monday,  21st April,  12:30 -- 1:30pm,  SH 6617</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: John Kaminsky</p>
					<p>TITLE: Introduction to Brownian Motion</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The probability distribution function is a measure on a probability
space describing the likelihood of an event occuring at a certain time.
One of the most important probability distributions is Brownian motion,
which describes the probability of two particles colliding at a certain
point.  The integral most often with respect to Brownian motion is the Ito
integral, which preserves the Martingale property of Brownian motion.  In
this talk, I will describe Brownian motion and its properties.  I will
then describe the construction of the Ito integral and give a proof of
Ito's formula, which is the functional method of computing Ito integrals.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Monday,  7th April,  12:30 -- 1:30pm,  SH 6617</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Tawny Lim</p>
					<p>TITLE: An Introduction to Image Processing</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: This talk will give a basic overview of image processing.  We will begin with a brief introduction, then move on to common problems and some models used to approach them. We will then conclude with a glance at current research and applications in the field.</p>
					<br>


					<h2>Grad Analysis Seminar - Winter 2014</h2>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  26th February,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Cynthia Flores</p>
					<p>TITLE: The IVP for the Benjamin Ono equation in weighted Sobolev spaces.</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: During this talk we will discuss the initial value problem associated to the Benjamin-Ono equation. The Benjamin-Ono equation is a nonlinear dispersive PDE and is a model for long internal waves traveling in a stratified fluid. A broad description of the methods motivated by harmonic analysis will be included in this discussion, along with a summary of well-posedness results in weighted Sobolev spaces.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  19th February,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Derek Smith</p>
					<p>TITLE: An Ill-posedness Result for a Fifth Order Nonlinear Dispersive PDE</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: As a consequence of the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces, if a PDE can be solved using the contraction mapping theorem, then the map from data to solution has a certain amount of regularity. We will focus on a specific model equation and show, with proper choice of data, the map data-solution cannot be C^2 at the origin (hence the contraction technique fails). The calculation is taken from a paper by Didier Pilod.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  12th February,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Boyan Jonov</p>
					<p>TITLE: Discussion of paper "Local Energy Decay for Solutions of Multi-Dimensional Isotropic Symmetric Hyperbolic Systems" by Sideris and Thomases</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: We will establish the local energy decay for solutions to certain linear hyperbolic systems with constraints. Such estimates are useful in treating nonlinear perturbations. Examples such as the Maxwell equation and linearized elasticity will be provided.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  5th February,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Ricardo Delgadillo</p>
					<p>TITLE: Introduction to Periodic Structures/Crystalline Solids</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: Mathematical description of periodic solids, i.e. Bravais Lattice and Reciprocal Lattice. Bloch's Theorem. Computation of Electronic Band structure and, X-Ray diffraction.</p>
					<br>
                    			<p>DATE: Wednesday,  29th January,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Jon Lo Kim Lin</p>
					<p>TITLE: The Lagrangian formulation for the Gaussian beam approximation to the Schr&#246;dinger equation.</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: I'll present the preliminaries from professor Xu Yang's paper "Gaussian Beam Methods For The Schr&#246;dinger Equation In The Semi-classical Regime: Lagrangian And Eulerian Formulations (2008)". More specifically, the solution to the Schr&#246;dinger equation is highly oscillatory when the rescaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ is small in the semi-classical regime. A direct numerical simulation requires the mesh-size to be $O(\varepsilon).$ The Gaussian beam method is an efficient way to solve the high frequency wave equations asymptotically, outperforming the geometric optics method in that the Gaussian beam method is accurate even at caustics.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  15th January,  11:00 -- 11:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Derek Smith</p>
					<p>TITLE: A tour of fractional calculus (a story of H^s well-posedness)</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: We all know that the Laplacian can be viewed as a Fourier multiplier, thus leading to one definition of fractional differentiation. I will review Duhamel's principle and how the contraction mapping theorem is used to prove existence and uniqueness of an IVP. We will then test drive this technique on the nonlinear Schr&#246;dinger equation with data in the Sobolev space H^s. Along the way, we will collect a list of theorems generalizing familiar calculus rules to the fractional derivative setting.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Grad Analysis Seminar - Fall 2013</h2>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  4th December,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Cynthia Flores</p>
					<p>TITLE: A discussion on the control theory of the linear periodic
Korteweg-de Vries equation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  20th November,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Daniel Salazar</p>
					<p>TITLE: A fast solver for the Fokker-Planck equation</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The coupled Navier-Stokes and Fokker-Planck equations are used in the modeling of complex fluids, such as oils, plastics and blood.  This coupling leads to a high-dimensional system of nonlinear equations, which are prohibitively costly to solve using standard numerical techniques.  In this talk I will present an efficient numerical method used to solve the Fokker-Planck equation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  13th November,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Jon Lo Kim Lin, Harris Enniss</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The diffusion equation for spherical particles with a fixed magnetic moment is solved numerically using the series expansion method. More specifically, the spherical harmonics on S^2. With the aid of Gaussian quadrature we calculate the effective viscosity of a ferrofluid. The result is compared with a decoupling approximation and the classical constitutive equation proposed by Shliomis.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  6th November,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Derek Smith</p>
					<p>TITLE: Singular Integral Operators</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: For exposition, we will focus on a linear, constant coefficient, partial differential operator. It will be split into a two factors using a sort of "polar" decomposition, the first factor being a singular integral operator and the second a power of the Laplacian. We will discuss invertibility of each of these factors, phrasing things in terms of the Riesz potential and Riesz transform. Finally, the singular integral operators will be seen as a special case of pseudo-differential operators.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  30th October,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Jon Lo Kim Lin</p>
					<p>TITLE: The Courant-Friedrichs-Levy Criterion</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) criterion for the stability of explicit time-stepping algorithms states that the time-step is bounded by a ratio involving the smallest spatial grid interval and the speed of the fasted wave. One reason why nearly-uniform finite difference or finite elements grids are popular is that the spatial increment is roughly the same everywhere so that the time-step limit is not unduly expensive. When confined to the sphere, the meridians (lines of constant longitude) all converge at the pole. Consequently the spatial grid size tends to zero as the pole is approached, even though the longitudinal mesh-size is constant. The very small grid spacing near the pole is known as the "pole problem": One must use a very, very short time step, or the numerical flow will violate the CFL criterion. Spherical harmonics fix the pole problem, contain the proper "parity factors", and offer exponential convergence for functions that are smooth on the sphere.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  23rd October,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Boyan Jonov</p>
					<p>TITLE: Null Condition for the 3D Wave Equation</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: We will prove  global existence of the solution to a small initial data quadratic wave in 3-D that satisfies a null condition. Quadratic waves in dimensions 4 and higher have global solutions for small data without restrictions on the non-linearity. In dimension 3, however, singularities can form in finite time even for small initial data. Thus, to achieve global solutions in 3-D, we need to restrict to a special type of non-linear terms that satisfy a null condition. We will use the energy method presented in previous talks.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  16th October,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Derek Smith</p>
					<p>TITLE: The Energy Method - Applications to Wave Equations</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: As someone studying PDE due to an interest in Fourier analysis, it took me a while to understand the usefulness of energy methods. We look at three existence results for the Cauchy problem for the wave equation: linear inhomogeneous equations, local problem for quasilinear equations, viscosity method for first order hyperbolic systems. In each case I will focus on the use of energy inequalities thus avoiding full proofs. Some of the ideas should reappear in Boyan's talk the following week.</p>
					<br>
					<p>DATE: Wednesday,  9th October,  1:00 -- 1:50pm,  SH 4607</p>
					<p>SPEAKER: Cynthia Flores</p>
					<p>TITLE: A decay property for solutions to the IVP of the Korteweg-de
Vries equation.</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: I will discuss the proof of Theorem 1.4 from the paper 'On decay properties of solutions to the k-generalized kdv equations.' The objective will be to deduce regularity of solutions under a decay assumption at two times.</p>
